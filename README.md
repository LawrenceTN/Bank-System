# Bank-System

This program is a simulated bank account system with all the necessary functions such as display balance, deposit, withdraw, and exit. Prior to these functions showing, the 
user must create an account with their username and 4-digit pin code. For this example, each created user will have a balance of $1,000.00 in their account. A file will be created
with the owner's information and will be updated/edited with every method chosen by the user.

This project is a WIP and will be receiving pull-requests for updates.
